## **1.  Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements.  Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**

  The Gaming Room is a client that has a popular Android only app called Draw It or Lose It.  Draw It or Lose It is loosely based on the 1980s television game *Win, Lose, or Draw* where contestents draw pictures to help team members guess the puzzle (a phrase, title, or thing).  The Gaming Room's game uses a library of pre-drawn images revealed slowly over the course of a round and players have to guess the puzzle.
  The Gaming Room would like to expand Draw It or Lose It to be completly cross-platform, and web based.  Clients will access the game through a web browser, and the games will be hosted on a central server.
  
## **2.  What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
  
  I feel that I was able to understand the requirements pretty well, and translate those into a pretty good technical design.  Leveraging previous experience with various server platforms I feel assisted greatly in this project.
    
##  **3.  What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

  I think that the way that the design document was broken up logically assisted in breaking up the entire project into portions that were much easier to visualize.
  
## **4.  If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

  The portion of this design document that I feel could use some refactoring is the REST API web app portion.  I feel that I still have a lot to learn about designing a REST API application, and I would like to research that further.
  
## **5.  How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

  I interpreted the users need for it to be cross platform and web based to needing to be a RESTful app.  It is critical to consider the users need when designing software because the users are why we are even designing and programming software.  In order for software to be successful, users have to want to use it.
  
## **6.  How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

  The approach that was followed in this project was a methodical structured approach.  Breaking the different requirements into smaller, bite sized chunks that were easier to visualize and design.  I think in the future I will follow this same approach and break down the entire software requirement into smaller related bits.  Taking those bits and breaking them down until there are many, easily designed units.
